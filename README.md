# vue-vuex-typescript-sfc bolierplate

This is an example on how to bring together vue2 vuex and typescript using single file class components.

Make sure to run Npm Install to install everything needed.

Important Points:

-Components are build in single files as class style components using vue-property-decorator

-Types for each component or store or really anything that requires it are imported from another file.

-Built in two example module stores to highlight how vuex with multiple store modules.

-Connection between store and components is through Vuex-Class and the decorators provided @State, @Action, @Getter, @Mutation

To build: Npm run build

To run: Npm run dev 

Runs on: //localhost:8080
